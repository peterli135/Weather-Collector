# Weather-Data-Scraper

What this Program does:
1. Input a location you want to search to retrieve the weather data off of Weather.com.
2. Selenium will automate the browser and input that keyword into the searchbox to get the first location that appears in the dropdown.
3. BeautifulSoup will then parse information on the website from the location specific link to get the 10 day weather data results.
4. Pandas will format the data to make it into a table where you can look at the weather data more closely.
